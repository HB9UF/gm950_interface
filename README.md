This is a simple interface that plugs into the back of Motorola GM950 radios to break out:

- Flat RX audio
- Flat TX audio
- The PTT line
- Open collector COS or TOS (depending on configuration)

The intended use for this project is to connect a link transceiver to the  EchoLink network. The interface was designed for the GM950 series but may also work with GM350 (untested). It was designed with KiCad 5.1.5 as a quick replacement for a failed unit. The first version was milled in-house during the COVID-19 lock-down, thus traces are extra wide and on a single layer to ease the manufacturing process.
